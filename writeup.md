# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!


## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points

Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

Criteria:

> Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

Criteria:

> Test that motion_planning.py is a modified version of backyard_flyer_solution.py for simple path planning. Verify that both scripts work. Then, compare them side by side and describe in words how each of the modifications implemented in motion_planning.py is functioning.

`motion_planning.py` program is implemented in the same Event-driven style of
programming as the previous "Backyard Flyer" exercise. They differ in the
algorithm that calculates waypoints. `backyard_flyer_solution.py` defines a
static set of waypoints. Motion planning uses A* algorithm on a grid to
calculate a path between two fixed locations (`start` and `goal`). The grid is
calculated from a set of obstacles provided as a `colliders.csv` CSV file.

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

Motion plannig algorithm is implemented in the `plan_path` function. It uses A*
algorithm on a 2.5d graph of randomly sampled points. Steps of the planning
algorithm is explained below.

#### 1. Read the obstacle data

We read obstacles from `colliders.csv` file and convert them to the
`shapely.geometry.Polygon` objects taking into account a `SAFETY_DISTANCE`
around them.

#### 2. Sample the random points on an obstacle map

Our implementation uses A* algorithm on a graph. Function `sample_points`
samples the vertices for the graph randomly on the map.  The upside of this
approach is that the search algorithm works very quickly on a graph (although
calculating the collision points may be resource intensive) The downside is that
it does not guarantee that the resulting path will be the most efficient.

I see the ideal algorithm like that. We move along some coarse-grained 2.5d path
on a graph and calculate obstacles around using some 3d representation as it was
described in the advanced section of the lectures.

#### 3. Set the starting position and points of interest

We define a current local position `point_local_position` that will be used as a
starting position in our path. We also define several points of interest:

- `point_middle_right` points to Harry Bridges Plaza on the middle right of the
  map. This point is interesting because it tests the ability to plan the path
  across the trees (areas with many low obstacles),

- `point_top_left` points to the dead end on the top left of the map. This point
  is interesting because it tests the ability to plan the path between the
  buildings and includes the area with some very low buildings.

- `point_bottom_right` points to the square on the bottom right. This point is
  interesting because it tests the ability to plan the path between the very
  tall buildings.

#### 4. Create a graph from points

Function `create_graph` creates graphs from the randomly sampled points. As an
optimization, it uses KDTree to check only the closest obstacles. Although it
may be hard to find all the obstacles since the edges may be lengthy. To
increase the accuracy of checking for collisions, it samples several points
along the edge and uses them to find the nearby collision points.

#### 5. Run A* algorithm

Function `a_star_graph` runs A* algorithm on a graph created on the previous
step and searches for a path between a `start` and `goal` points.

#### 6. Send waypoints

As a final step, we send waypoints calculated by the `a_star_graph` algorithm to
the sim.


### Execute the flight

Criteria:

> This is simply a check on whether it all worked. Send the waypoints and the autopilot should fly you from start to goal!

I was able to fly between all three points of interest.
